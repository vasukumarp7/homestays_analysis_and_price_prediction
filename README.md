# homestays_analysis_and_price_prediction

In this Home stays analysis and price prediction project, I did data Preprocessing steps like filling null values, cleaning, one hot encoding and removing redundant data. Then I did data visualization technique like correlation heat map to understand the relation between variables, box for to understand the data quartile range and bar plot to find the, which category correlated with the price. Then plotted the map using latitude and longitude variables to understand the price distribution across cities. I also calculated the sentiment score based on description features, calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient to find which amenities is highly correlated with price variable. I one hot encode the categorical variables for machine learning analysis and removed the redundant data. I used seven regression models Linear Regression, Lasso, ridge, KNN Regressor, Decision Tree regressor, Random Forest regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Then I used Grid Search Cross validation for less exhaustive models and Random Search Cross validation for high exhaustive models. I derived feature importance and SHAP values from tree based models, i also used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared to evaluate the model performance. The insights in this analysis Home Characteristics and amenities have high correlation with price over host information. Based on the model result, focusing on high price correlation amenities and home characteristics, it will increase the profit. Also, remove the low correlated amenities and house characteristics to save the money.
